\chapter{Future Work}

\section{Further testing}

Further testing with users needs to be carried out to test in a live environment but also getting the application into a few users' hands would be beneficial.  This would allow for some feedback on obvious issues with the application that hasn't yet been thought up.

Sending out the user server would also be beneficial. After developing the application the user server questionnaire is also better now too. 

\section{Next steps of development}

The first thing would be to refactor the application to use the application factory method of development as this with simplify added unit tests to the development side of the application. 

For the next steps, working on fulfilling the rest of the requirements is an important step. Making the application into a PWA would also be beneficial in the long run instead of making a dedicated mobile application to allow for faster development with only being focused on one codebase.

Working out how to handle the content when rolling over to the next academic year will also be very important but if the application was deployed for users in the following academic, then there would be one year to figure it out. This is why it wasn't deemed important for the MVP despite being an obvious flaw.
