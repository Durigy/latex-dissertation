\section{Testing}

\subsection{Unit testing}
\subsubsection{Database}
No unit tests were carried out. To carry out unit tests, the application should be refactored to use the create application method which allows for different instances of the application to be created. The main production application and the development and testing application. The development version would use a local SQLite database to allow for testing of the application without altering the production version. This would also simplify the process of creating unit tests.

\subsubsection{Routes/Views}
In the current version of the application, routes were unable to be tested using unit tests. This is due to the way the application is called. For routes to be tested using unit tests, the application would need to be refactored to use the create app factory technique. This allows different versions of the application to be used such as a development version, a testing version and a production version.

\subsection{User testing}
The current user testing was done by myself on both mobile and desktop, but further testing will need to be done with other users on a greater range of devices. For the application, a Samsung Note 10 with the Google Chrome browser was used for mobile, and a ThinkPad T460p was used for Desktop on both the Firefox and Google Chrome browsers. 

One of the notable differences between the Firefox and Google Chrome browsers was the scroll bar. The way the application was built worked correctly on Firefox, but the scroll bar didn't work correctly. To solve this issue a new scroll bar design was coded using CSS. In Firefox only the scroll bar for where the user hovers is shown but in Google Chrome, all the scroll bars are shown. The new design replicated the Firefox design in Google Chrome. 

\section{Limitations of the prototype}
Some current limitations of the prototype are:

- Most items can't be edited by a user
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lectures
        \item Posts
        \item Questions
        \item Messages
        \item Comments
        \item Module resources
    \end{itemize}
- Most items can't be deleted by a user once created/posted
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Posts
        \item Questions
        \item Messages
        \item Comments
        \item Module resources
    \end{itemize}
- Tutors can't sign-up/register for the application as easily as a student can. It requires a tutor to send an email, then create an account, send a new email with the username, and then the admin of the site can change that user to a tutor. \newline\newline
- There is no content algorithm for what posts should be shown. All posts by all users from all schools and years are shown together in the order they are posted.\newline\newline
- There is no filtering or searching for questions. However, a user can only see questions for the modules they follow/subscribe to.\newline\newline
- There is no filtering or searching for users either.\newline\newline
- There is no dedicated section for tutors,  but as the application is an MVP, it was focused on the students, they had to be prioritised over the tutors.
