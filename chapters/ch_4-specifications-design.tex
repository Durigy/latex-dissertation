    \item Preferred Channels: Discord, Reddit, WhatsApp
    \item Bio:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Feona is a first-year student from the School of Computer Science who would like the ability to easily connect with other students on her course and find helpful resources for questions she has about specific activities as part of the modules she is taking
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Person 2
\begin{itemize}
    \item Name: John
    \item Age: 19
    \item Relationship: Single
    \item Location: Lives in a flat with room-mates
    \item School of study: English Language
    \item Frustrations: Fed up of the timetables not being updated correctly
    \item Hobbies: Reading, Clubbing, Rowing, writing short stories
    \item Preferred Channels: Instagram, WhatsApp, MS Teams
    \item Bio:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item John is a 19-year-old student studying English Language. They enjoy sitting for hours writing stories. They often forget to check their timetable and end up late for lectures, or when they do, a tutor may have changed the time, putting a message on the VLE and emailing students. Unfortunately, the timetables haven't been updated, and John rarely checks their emails, so they have turned up to lectures that don't exist on more than one occasion.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}

To define the actors in the requirements: "Student" is a Student, "Tutor" is a Tutor, and "User" is used when the requirement applies to both the Student and Tutor actors.

The requirements are broken into " must have, " " should have, " and "could have". Must have - the requirement must be present in the MVP. Should have - a desired requirement but not as important for proving the prototype's usability. Could have - requirements that are unlikely to make it into the final version of the prototype but should be included in further development if the application proves to work and be valuable to users.

\section{Database}
Throughout our course at university, we have had the opportunity to use multiple types of databases such as SQL, MongoDB and GraphDB. The prototype application uses an SQL-based (MySQL in RDS) for storing data using the following tables:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.36]{images/database/database_diagram.png}
    \caption{Database design}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The tables}

\subsubsection{User}
The user table holds the essential information about a user of the application.

\subsubsection{University}
The University table is used to hold information about a university, such as name, location, etc.

\subsubsection{UniversitySchool}
The university school table is used for linking users, universities, and modules together. Defines the school the user is part of when they are linked to it and segregates the modules into the correct schools.

\subsubsection{UniversityYear}
The university year table is similar to the university school table but defines the year of study, e.g. Year 1.

\subsubsection{Module}
The module table has the main information about a module and is used to connect anything for a specific module, such as lectures, resources and notes.

\subsubsection{ModuleLecture}
The module lecture table is used by a tutor to define upcoming lectures, whether they are in person or online. It allows a tutor to link Zoom/MS Teams link for online lectures and a quiz link to Mentimeter/Kahoot for improving student engagement. This allows a student quick access to the information they need to know for a lecture in one easy place.

\subsubsection{ModuleQuestion}
The module question table is used for a student to post questions and link them to a module.

\subsubsection{ModuleQuestionComment}

The module question comment table links to the module question table and allows users to post their replies to a question.

\subsubsection{Image}
The image table is used to hold information about images uploaded to the application by users. This holds the location of the image, title and description of the image added by users.

\subsubsection{Document}
The document table is similar to the image table and holds the same information structures but is separated to split out images and documents for organisation purposes and to allow the image table to be used for image-specific purposes in the future.

\subsubsection{ModuleResource}
The module resource table is used to link a row in the image or document table to a module.

\subsubsection{ModuleReview}
The module review table is used to hold the reviews from students on a module. This table didn't end up getting used in the prototype but is left to add it in the future.

\subsubsection{ModuleSubscription}
The module subscription table is used to link a user to a module. When a user is subscribed to a module, information and intractability with the module become possible. It allows users to choose modules they want to see information for on their home page and sidebar.

\subsubsection{PublicProfile}
The public profile table is used for a user to add information they want to be seen publicly by other users. For the prototype, only a user bio is added, but it allows for future expansions, such as allowing a user to add their interest/hobbies, pronouns, etc. It also means that only the needed essential information for a user is accessed in the user table, which is accessed almost every time a user interacts with the application. This will allow the application to scale better if and when it expands.

\subsubsection{PublicPost}
The public post table is similar to the module question table but is used when a user wants to post things publicly for other users not subscribed to a specific module. This would be left to the user to decide what to post but would be expected to be used for leisure purposes, not university or study-specific purposes.

\subsubsection{PublicPostComment}
The public post comment table is similar to the module question comment table but links to a public post instead.

\subsubsection{Message}
The massage table is used to hold the contents and metadata of a message a user sends in the real-time chat sections.

\subsubsection{MessageThread}
The message thread table is used to link a collection of messages into one stream (conversation). It allows a user to click on a chat and only see the message specific to that conversation.

\subsubsection{Note}
The note table is used to hold the notes a user creates. This can be linked to a module to see the note's purpose easily.

\section{Wire-framing}

To get an idea for the design, wireframes were created on paper. The designs have been annotated to point out and denote the different sections, such as pointing out the header/navigation. As the application is getting built, it will change, but these designs should give an example of how the application could look for some of the sections.

\subsection{User home}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.14]{images/wireframe/user_home.jpg}
    \caption{User home page wireframe}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
This design is to show what the user will first see upon logging into the application. It shows the top part of the page (above the fold).

\subsection{Lectures}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{images/wireframe/lectures.jpg}
    \caption{User lecture list page wireframe}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
This design is to show an example of what a page with different list items will look like, for example, the list of questions, list of lectures, list of all modules, etc. 

\subsection{Mobile}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.13]{images/wireframe/mobile.jpg}
    \caption{Mobile example wireframe}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

This is an example of how the application could look on a mobile device. It doesn't show any specific page but instead how the mobile menu would differ. The navigation collapses into a hamburger menu and drops down when the user taps on the button.

\section{Use cases}

\subsection{Lectures}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/use cases/lectures.png}
    \caption{Lectures use case diagram}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

Users have different relationships with lectures depending on which actors they are. Students can view the list of lectures and click to view more information about a lecture. Tutors can do this too, but they also have the ability to create and delete lectures.

\subsection{Messages}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/use cases/messages.png}
    \caption{Message  use case diagram}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

All users have the ability to interact with each other through Real-time messaging, which is accessible from the messages section and the module page for module chats. Users can view messages and threads they are linked to and send a message to the thread. A thread may contain two users for direct messaging or many users for module chats.

\subsection{Module}
 
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.36]{images/use cases/module.png}
    \caption{Module use case diagram}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

On a single module page, there are a lot of the functions from above, viewing lectures and real-time messaging. There is also the viewing of module resources, other uses who are subscribed to the module, module questions and about the module. A student can click to create a student resource, whereas a tutor can click to create a tutor resource or to create a lecture.

\subsection{Notes}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/use cases/notes.png}
    \caption{Notes use case diagram}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

Notes are not restricted to use, but students, as a tutor, may decide to keep their notes for a lecture in the application to keep them in one place. For this reason, all users can view, create and edit notes.

\section{Wireframes}

To get an idea for the design, wireframes were created on paper. The designs have been annotated to point out and denote the different sections, such as pointing out the header/navigation. As the application is getting built, it will change, but these designs should give an example of how the application could look for some of the sections.

\subsection{User home}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{images/wireframe/user_home.jpg}
    \caption{User home page wireframe}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
This design is to show what the user will first see upon logging into the application. It shows the top part of the page (above the fold).

\subsection{Lectures}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{images/wireframe/lectures.jpg}
    \caption{User lecture list page wireframe}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
This design is to show an example of what a page with different list items will look like, for example, the list of questions, list of lectures, list of all modules, etc. 

\subsection{Mobile}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{images/wireframe/mobile.jpg}
    \caption{Mobile example wireframe}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

This is an example of how the application could look on a mobile device. It doesn't show any specific page but instead how the mobile menu would differ. The navigation collapses into a hamburger menu and drops down when the user taps on the button.
