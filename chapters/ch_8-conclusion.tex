\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude the project, the prototype successfully works as intended without any known flaws but that's only on the functionality side. Based on experience the application is good enough for me to use, but it is still unknown if it is suitable for the general student population's basic needs or if it is even wanted by other students. Other students might be happy enough with the current VLE and connect with students in other ways for the short time the average student is at university.

User testing needs to be done to see if the application actually addresses the main needs of the student across a wide number of students. A user study also needs to be carried out over a period of time such as three to six months to get a good idea of how students interact with the application and what they use the most. This would help with pinpointing the most valuable areas to focus on development.
